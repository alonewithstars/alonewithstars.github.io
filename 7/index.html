I&rsquo;m not gonna kill myself. But have I thought about what it would be like to just not be here anymore? And I don&rsquo;t say that casually, but I do say it because hiding that shit and not saying it makes it worse. It should be talked about. All of our shit should be talked about.
The teenage years are limbo. You&rsquo;re somewhere between being a kid and an adult, and the world tells you to be mature and express yourself, but the minute that you do, it tells you to shut up. The thing is, adults are just scarred kids who were lucky enough to make it out of limbo alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="/Chemical_Hearts.jpeg" alt="Chemical Hearts"> The day before yesterday, my classmate from school committed suicide. I do not know the reason, but I can guess. I was 14 when I handled the death of a classmate for the first time. The school did not even acknowledge or spend a few minutes to remember her since it was a suicide. Teachers just tried to hide it from the students. We whispered amongst ourselves about what happened.
Despite the teachers being against it, I went to her funeral. I wanted to see her for one last time.</p>
<p>I was 17, the second time. I still did not know how to feel. I was not that close to her, but she was my partner during lab hours. I could feel her absence for the rest of the term. In exam halls when teachers asked about why her seat was empty, I could not answer. I could not say that aloud, that she passed away. It might be stupid but it&rsquo;s hard for me to tell that someone passed away.  When I hear of a death, for some time I feel guilty to smile. I feel someone nagging me inside, to stop smiling.</p>
<p>Depression is still a taboo and suicides a sin. The society acts like mental health issues does not exist. We blame the person for not having the courage to go on, but we do not discuss their reasons to not. Everyone needs a person who can understand and relate to their confusion. We do not want to be told about how to feel about anything, we want to find that out for ourselves. Society must be able to provide an open and non-judgemental space to express their feelings and fears. As Grace said, all of our shit should be talked about. I just wanted to spill my feelings out somewhere.</p>
<p>PS: I am still not sure if it is disrespectful to their memory to talk about them.</p>
